   <p class="description">Italian Sausage and Mushroom Lasagna with Bechamel Sauce</p>
    <div class="description">The bechamel adds a little something special to this wonderful lasagna. I like to use part skim ricotta and mozzarella and low-fat milk to cut some of the fat in this dish.</div>
    <p><em>You won't notice the difference.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 serving cooking spray</li>
      <li>½ pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups low-fat milk</li>
      <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 (15 pounce) container part-skim ricotta chesse</li>
      <li>1tablespoon dried parsley</li>
      <li>2 (24 ounce) jars marinara sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 (9ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped cremini mushrooms, divided</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded part-skim mozzarella chesse, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375degree F. (190 degrees C).Spray a 9x13-inch backing disch with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place the sausage in a skillet over medium heat and cook until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain the sausage and set aside.</li>
        <li>
          To make bechamel sauce, melt the butter in a saucepan over medium heat and whisk in the flour. Allow the flour and butter to cook until light and foamy, about 2 minutes, whisking constantly; whisk in milk, a little at a time. Whisk in the salt
          and nutmeg and bring the sauce to a bare simmer, whisking constantly until
          thickened, about 10 minutes. Remove sauce from the heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, beat the egg and stir in the ricotta cheese and parsley until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>
          To assemble lasagna, pour about 1 1/2 cup of marinara sauce into the bottom of
          the prepared baking dish and top the sauce with 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping
          if necessary. On the noodles, layer 1/3 of the ricotta mixture, followed by 1/3 of
          the cooked sausage, 1/3 cup of mushrooms, 1/4 of the bechamel sauce, 1 cup of
          the mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup of the Parmesan cheese and 1 more cup of
          marinara sauce. Repeat the layers twice more, ending with a final layer of
          noodles topped with a layer of marinara sauce, bechamel sauce, the remaining
          mozzarella cheese, and remaining Parmesan cheese. Cover the dish with foil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and the noodles are tender, about 1 hour. Remove foil and bake until the top cheese layer is browned, about 5 more
          minutes. Allow the lasagna to stand for 10 minutes before cutting.
        </li>
      </ol>
